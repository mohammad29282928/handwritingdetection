# handwritingdetection
In this project we are going to make a system for detection and analyses documents which most of them are hand writing.

generalize input files:
There are multiple input files, so we need to convert all of them as a single format. In our case the best one is jpeg format. 
We need to make a script to handle the following file formats:
stream
image formats (png, svd, ...)
pdf
docs
